# Description file is the heart of my R package
# NAMESPACE file is equally important. Don't edit this file by hand, unless there are strange things to fix.
# R folder is the key
# xkcd.Rproj is just a RStudio project file
# Rbuildignore tells what file to ignore: when I build the R package, pretend "^xkcd\.Rproj$^\.Rproj\.user$" don't exist.

# set up git: usethis::use_git()
