- POINTS TO ADDRESS
- what is the point? What is this package for? Is it different or unique in some way? 
- How do I install it? 
- How do I get started with using it? 

The goal of xkcd is to ...
 

## Installation

You can install the development version of xkcd from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("XXinZ28/xkcd")
```

## Example Usage

ThGiven an xkcd comic number, the xkcd() function returns a list object with metadata about the comic. 

```{r example}
library(xkcd)

first_comic <- xkcd(1)
print(first_comic)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
